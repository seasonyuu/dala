## Features

- **Persistent shells** — every session lives in its own PTY holder daemon (dtach model, written in Rust). Restarting or upgrading dala leaves your shells running: tmux durability, browser UI.
- **Git review** — hunk-level *and* line-level stage/unstage/discard, working-tree/index dual perspectives, branch switching, per-file commit browsing, amend. All through a libgit2 NIF, no shelling out.
- **Files** — VS Code-style drawer: upload/download/delete, drag & drop, paste files from the OS clipboard, `Ctrl/⌘+P` fuzzy quick-open. Large text/HTML downloads stream with HTTP gzip while byte ranges remain resumable.
- **Editing & preview** — CodeMirror 6 syntax-highlighted editor, character-level merge diffs, Markdown/CSV preview.
- **Screenshots for AI CLIs** — paste an image into the terminal; dala saves it to disk and types the file path for claude code / codex / opencode.
- **Self-upgrade** — one click in the sidebar updates to the latest GitHub release. Shells stay alive through the restart.

## Quick start (Linux x86_64 / Linux arm64 / macOS arm64)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjason/dala/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs a prebuilt native release as a **user daemon** on
`http://localhost:4400`: systemd on Linux, or the signed and notarized server
under launchd on Apple Silicon Macs.
Config lives in `~/.config/dala/config.jsonc`, data in `~/.local/share/dala`.

To update later — either click the sidebar update button, or:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjason/dala/main/update.sh | bash
```

## Desktop client

An Electron app (Windows / macOS / Linux) that manages multiple dala
servers, VS Code style. Chromium engine means rendering, IME and clipboard
behave exactly like Chrome on every platform:

- **Servers menu** — switch the current window between servers
  (`Ctrl/⌘+1..9`), or open a server **in a new window**; one window per
  server works like VS Code workspaces
- Sign-in state is kept per server (60-day persistent login), the last-used
  server reopens on launch
- Manage servers on the built-in page (`Ctrl/⌘+,`)
- External links from the terminal open in a built-in browser window

Client releases use their own tags (`client-vX.Y.Z`), independent from
server releases (`vX.Y.Z`) — so they never carry the "Latest" badge.
Download the installer for your OS from the
[client releases](https://github.com/mjason/dala/releases?q=client&expanded=true)
(`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb`/`.AppImage`).

> **macOS**: the universal `.dmg` (Apple Silicon + Intel) is signed and
> notarized (Developer ID) — it opens without any Gatekeeper prompt.

> Upgrading from the Tauri client (≤ v0.5.x)? Your server list is imported
> automatically on first launch.

> **Auto-update**: since client-v0.1.2 the client checks for new versions
> (on launch and every 4 hours), downloads in the background and offers a
> one-click restart; File → Check for Updates triggers it manually.

Build from source:

```sh
cd clients/desktop && npm install && npm run build
```

## Usage guide

### Sessions

The sidebar lists your shells. `+` creates one; each runs on the server inside its
own holder process, so closing the tab, refreshing, restarting dala or upgrading
it never kills a shell. A session that *exited* (the process itself ended) shows
an overlay with a restart button. Per-session settings (rename, scrollback cache
size, kill/restart, delete) are behind the `settings` button.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut (Linux/Windows · macOS) | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+P` · `⌘P` | Quick-open a file (fuzzy search; on macOS it works even while the terminal is focused) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+E` · `⇧⌘E` | File drawer |
| `Ctrl+Shift+G` · `⇧⌘G` | Git panel |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` · `⇧⌘F` | Refit terminal width |
| `Ctrl+Shift+X` · `⇧⌘X` | Reset terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+K` · `⇧⌘K` (or click the strip below the terminal) | **Composer** (Warp-style rich input): CodeMirror Markdown editor (highlighted code fences, Tab indent, Enter newline), **Shift+Enter delivers the whole line**, `@` references files, `/` completes commands (incl. custom commands/skills), `+` attaches |
| `Ctrl+\`` (Control on macOS too — `⌘\`` is taken by the OS) | Focus the terminal from anywhere |
| `Ctrl+Shift+\`` (or the `⚡>_` header button) | **Quick shell**: a disposable overlay terminal (slides over the session, drag its left edge to resize, one-click fullscreen) already cd'd into the active session's directory; `+` in the panel opens more tabs. **Esc closes it** — every quick shell is destroyed on the spot, nothing is kept (inside vim & co. Esc belongs to the program); `exit`/`Ctrl+D` closes a single tab |
| `Esc` | Close the topmost window |

The sidebar, quick shell, file drawer and git panel edges are all draggable (widths remembered per browser); double-click a divider to reset that panel, or use "Reset layout" in settings to reset them all.

File drawer: `↑↓` select · `⏎` open · `⌫` parent directory · `Del` delete ·
`Esc` deselect (uploads then target the root) · `Ctrl/⌘+V` paste a copied file.
Diff windows: `i` inline · `s` side-by-side · `l` line-select mode · `Alt+Z` wrap.
Every button shows its shortcut in a hover tooltip.

### Git panel

Open it with `Ctrl+Shift+G` in any session whose directory is inside a git repo.

- **Changes** — staged and unstaged lists (a file with both kinds of changes
  appears in both). Click a file for a syntax-highlighted diff with two
  perspectives: unstaged (index ↔ working tree) and staged (HEAD ↔ index).
- **Hunks & lines** — every change block has Stage/Discard/Unstage buttons
  (inline and side-by-side modes). Press `l` for line-select mode: tick
  individual `+`/`-` lines and stage/discard/unstage exactly those.
- **Commit** — message box at the bottom; `Amend (--amend)` melds staged
  changes into the previous commit (empty message keeps the original).
- **Branches** — click the branch name in the header to list local/remote
  branches and switch (remote branches get a local tracking branch). Dirty
  conflicts abort safely.
- **History** — commit log; multi-file commits get a file rail so you can
  review file by file.

### Agent awareness (Claude Code / opencode / Codex…)

dala speaks Warp's open cli-agent protocol (OSC 777). Install the agent's
plugin once and you get the integration:

**Claude Code** (run inside Claude Code, then restart it or `/reload-plugins`):

```
/plugin marketplace add warpdotdev/claude-code-warp
/plugin install warp@claude-code-warp
```

**opencode** (add to `opencode.json`):

```json
{ "plugin": ["@warp-dot-dev/opencode-warp"] }
```

**Codex** needs no plugin (native notifications). **Gemini CLI**: install
`warpdotdev/gemini-cli-warp` (see its README).

With that in place:

- **Notifications** when a task finishes / awaits your approval / asks you a
  question while you're on another session or away (click jumps to it)
- **Sidebar status dots**: ✳ working (mint pulse) / ⏳ needs you (amber
  pulse) / ✓ done (blue, cleared when viewed)
- **Composer auto-toggle**: opens while the agent works or finishes (without
  stealing focus), closes when an approval wants raw terminal keys

Codex needs no plugin (its native OSC 9 notifications work). Note that
sessions started before an upgrade need their shell restarted (holders
outlive releases).

**Tip — Claude Code after a width change**: when the terminal width changes
(e.g. a phone takes over the session's size), Claude Code keeps its
transcript hard-wrapped at the old width (upstream:
[anthropics/claude-code#43113](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43113)).
Press **Ctrl+O twice** to re-render the transcript at the current width
in-session — or `claude --continue` after exiting.

### Directory following

The file drawer follows the terminal's working directory. The shell is polled
(2s) by default; for instant `cd` updates you can optionally add the standard
**OSC 7** report, which takes over from polling entirely.
For zsh (`~/.zshrc`):

```zsh
_osc7() { printf '\e]7;file://%s%s\a' "$HOST" "$PWD" }
autoload -U add-zsh-hook && add-zsh-hook chpwd _osc7 && _osc7
```

For bash (`~/.bashrc`):

```bash
PROMPT_COMMAND='printf "\e]7;file://%s%s\a" "$HOSTNAME" "$PWD"'"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+;$PROMPT_COMMAND}"
```

(Many setups — vte.sh, WezTerm/Kitty shell integration — already emit
OSC 7.)

### Images for AI CLIs

Run claude code / codex / opencode inside a dala shell and paste a screenshot
(`Ctrl/⌘+V`): dala stores it under the session directory and types its path
into the prompt — the same flow those CLIs support in a native terminal.

## Project config: dala.jsonc

Everything works with zero configuration — the file editor's LSP resolves
servers per project automatically (a Python venv's basedpyright, rust-analyzer,
elixir-ls, typescript-language-server, gopls… probed from the venv, PATH,
`~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin` and Mason). A `dala.jsonc` at the project root
takes over when the defaults aren't enough. Comments and trailing commas are
allowed.

```jsonc
{
  // Override which language servers attach, per language. Several servers
  // can share one file (e.g. a framework's DSL server next to pyright).
  "lsp": {
    "python": [
      { "command": [".venv/bin/basedpyright-langserver", "--stdio"] },
      { "command": [".venv/bin/dm", "lsp"] },          // framework DSL server
    ],
  },

  // Monorepos: map sub-projects to their own root. The longest matching
  // path prefix wins; the LSP rootUri and working directory land there.
  "projects": {
    "assets": {                                         // frontend at <root>/assets
      "lsp": { "typescript": [ { "command": ["node_modules/.bin/tsls", "--stdio"] } ] },
    },
    "clients/desktop": {},                              // {} = auto-discovery at that root
  },

  // Voice input: the Whisper transcription prompt. The model treats it as
  // the PRECEDING transcript and mimics its spelling and punctuation, so
  // write a natural sentence (in the language you speak) with your jargon
  // embedded — not a bare keyword list. Only the last ~224 tokens count.
  // Per project — editable from Settings' Voice tab, which reads/writes
  // the nearest dala.jsonc (created here when missing).
  "speech": {
    "prompt": "This session covers dala, zellij, Phoenix LiveView and basedpyright.",
  },

  // Composer slash-command menu: extend or patch the per-agent command
  // catalog. dala ships tables curated from each CLI's official docs
  // (priv/agent_commands) and scans the CLIs' own custom-command files
  // (.claude/commands|skills, ~/.codex/prompts, opencode command dirs) —
  // when a CLI update adds commands first, add them here (or globally in
  // <data_dir>/agent_commands/<agent>.json). Entries override built-ins by
  // name; "hidden": true removes one from the menu.
  "agentCommands": {
    "codex": [
      { "name": "/my-new-cmd", "description": "Added by a newer Codex" },
      { "name": "/quit", "hidden": true },
    ],
  },
}
```

Each server entry also accepts **`initializationOptions`** (sent verbatim in
the LSP `initialize` request) and **`settings`** (delivered via
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration` — how pyright-family servers take
`python.pythonPath`, `venvPath` and friends):

```jsonc
{ "lsp": { "python": [ {
    "command": ["pyright-langserver", "--stdio"],
    "settings": { "python": { "pythonPath": "${root}/.venv/bin/python" } },
} ] } }
```

Rules:

- **Command words expand** `~`, `$VAR` / `${VAR}` and `${root}` (the project
  root) — inside `initializationOptions`/`settings` string values too.
  Relative paths resolve against the root.
- **Nearest config wins**: a `dala.jsonc` inside a sub-directory beats the
  top-level one for files under it — an alternative to `"projects"`.
- A `"projects"` entry without `"lsp"` still moves the root: auto-discovery
  then runs *at the sub-project* (its venv, its node_modules).
- The legacy `.dala/lsp.json` (the bare `lsp` map as the whole file) keeps
  working; `dala.jsonc` wins when both exist.
- The editor's **LSP debug window** shows, per file, which config applied and
  every probed path (found or missing) — same data at `GET /lsp/debug` for
  AI agents.

## Application guide

- **Long-running AI agents.** Kick off a multi-hour agent run, close the
  laptop, come back from any browser: the shell, its scrollback and the agent
  are still there. This is the core reason dala exists — terminal multiplexers
  work, but a browser tab with persistent state travels better.
- **Review what the agent wrote.** The git panel is built for the "AI writes,
  human reviews" loop: skim per-file diffs, stage exactly the lines you accept,
  discard the rest, amend fixups — without leaving the browser.
- **Multi-device access.** Expose dala on your LAN (see deployment guide),
  enable login, and drive the same shells from a phone or tablet.

## Deployment guide

### Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/dala/versions/<tag>` | unpacked releases |
| `~/.local/dala/current` | symlink to the active version |
| `~/.config/dala/config.jsonc` | server configuration (port, listen address, auth, …) |
| `~/.local/share/dala/secrets.json` | auto-generated secrets (0600, created on first boot) |
| `~/.config/dala/dala.env` | LEGACY environment file — still honored as overrides on old installs |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/dala.service` (Linux) | systemd user unit |
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.manjialin.dala.plist` (macOS) | launchd user agent |
| `~/.local/share/dala` | SQLite DB, session store, scrollback cache |

The unit runs `Dala.Release.migrate()` before every start, so upgrades migrate
the database automatically. `KillMode=process` keeps PTY holders (and your
shells) alive across service restarts.

### Configuration reference (`~/.config/dala/config.jsonc`)

Configuration is a FILE on purpose: the service process carries no
dala-specific environment variables, so nothing can leak into the shells it
spawns (and nothing collides with whatever you run inside them). Secrets are
generated by the server on first boot (`<dataDir>/secrets.json`, 0600) — you
never write them. Restart the service after editing.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `4400` | HTTP port |
| `listenIp` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Listen address. **Loopback only by default** — `"0.0.0.0"` serves the LAN (enable auth!) |
| `auth.enabled` | `false` | Require sign-in |
| `auth.users` | — | Bootstrap accounts, `"email:password[,email2:password2]"` (min 8-char passwords). **First-boot only**: existing accounts are never touched — remove once created so the plaintext doesn't linger. Password reset: add `"usersReset": true` for one boot |
| `host` / `scheme` / `urlPort` | `"localhost"` / `"http"` / `port` | Public URL parts (set behind a reverse proxy) |
| `checkOrigin` | `false` | WebSocket origin check — enable behind a reverse proxy with a fixed host |
| `databasePath` | `<dataDir>/dala.db` | SQLite location |
| `dataDir` | `~/.local/share/dala` | Session store, scrollback cache, secrets |
| `releaseRoot` / `serviceName` | set by install.sh | Enable the in-app updater |
| `server` | `true` (written by install.sh) | Start the HTTP server (release installs) |

Upload/preview size limits live under `"limits"`
(`drawerUploadMaxMb`, `browserAttachmentMaxMb`, `mcpAttachmentMaxMb`,
`attachmentStorageMaxMb`, `textSaveMaxMb`, `textPreviewDefaultMb`,
`textPreviewMaxMb`), and `updateRepo`/`dnsClusterQuery` are available too.

Environment variables are for DEVELOPMENT and legacy installs only, and
dala's own env names are `DALA_`-prefixed (`DALA_PORT`, `DALA_HOST`, … —
generic names like `PORT` collide with other tools; the bare legacy names
keep working solely for old `dala.env` installs). **Once `config.jsonc`
exists, every environment variable is ignored** — a configured install is
deterministic. Old installs should migrate: one command, reversible —

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjason/dala/main/migrate-config.sh | bash
```

see [docs/config-migration.md](docs/config-migration.md). Legacy-mode
servers show a migration notice in the sidebar footer.

On Linux, `install.sh` runs `loginctl enable-linger` so the daemon also runs
while you are logged out. The macOS LaunchAgent starts when the user logs in.

### LAN access

1. In `config.jsonc`: `"listenIp": "0.0.0.0"` and
   `"auth": { "enabled": true, "users": "you@example.com:yourpassword" }`,
   then restart. Once you can sign in, **remove `users`** — the account is
   persisted; don't leave the plaintext password in the file.
2. Open `http://<machine-ip>:<port>` from another device.
3. **WSL2**: use mirrored networking (`.wslconfig` → `networkingMode=mirrored`)
   and allow the port through the Hyper-V firewall (admin PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallHyperVRule -Name dala-4400 -DisplayName "dala 4400" `
     -Direction Inbound -VMCreatorId "{40E0AC32-46A5-438A-A0B2-2B479E8F2E90}" `
     -Protocol TCP -LocalPorts 4400
   ```

A terminal server hands out your shell — never expose it without auth, and
prefer a VPN (tailscale etc.) over raw internet exposure.

### HTTPS / reverse proxy

dala serves plain http by design; TLS belongs to a reverse proxy (nginx/caddy).
The Phoenix generator's `force_ssl` block was removed in v0.1.2 (it only
exempted `localhost`, so LAN-IP access got 301-redirected to
`https://localhost/`). To force https behind a TLS proxy, put it back in
`config/prod.exs` (compile-time — requires a rebuild):

```elixir
config :dala, DalaWeb.Endpoint,
  force_ssl: [
    rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto],
    exclude: [
      hosts: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
    ]
  ]
```

and set `"scheme": "https"`, `"host": "<your-domain>"`, `"checkOrigin": true`
in `config.jsonc`.

### Releases & building from source

Releases are built by GitHub Actions on every `v*` tag
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`): production assets, Rust NIFs and the PTY
holder are packaged for Linux x86_64, Linux arm64 and macOS arm64. Every Mach-O artifact in
the macOS release is signed with the Developer ID certificate and the complete
release is submitted to Apple notarization before publication.

Local development needs Elixir 1.19+/OTP 28, Rust and Node 22:

```sh
mix setup
mix phx.server        # http://localhost:4000
```

To install a source-built, arch-native user daemon from a checkout (useful for
local changes or before your fork publishes a `linux-arm64` asset):

```sh
DALA_INSTALL_FROM_SOURCE=1 ./install.sh
```

## Architecture

- Phoenix + Bandit server, React + xterm.js frontend (Phoenix Channels transport)
- One `dala_holder` (Rust) per session: a daemonized PTY owner with an
  **embedded headless terminal emulator** (`alacritty_terminal`) — the tmux
  model. Attaching gets a synthesized repaint (history tail + screen +
  cursor + modes) instead of a raw byte replay, so attach latency is
  independent of how much output the session ever produced and alt-screen
  apps (vim, htop) reattach pixel-perfect
- `dala_git` (Rustler + libgit2): status/diff/stage/patch-apply/branches/checkout as NIFs
- SQLite (Ash + Ecto) for accounts, DETS for sessions & scrollback cache
